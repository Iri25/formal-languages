### Design a program that:
1. Adaptation of the lexical analysis program so that it uses finite automata to determine the sequences corresponding to the lexical atoms (The program will obtain FIP, TS).
2. Integration into the lexical analysis programs of the description of the real constants (literal) from the original language.

### Design a program that:

One of the following syntactic analysis methods will be used:
- descent with returns
- ll(1)
- slr
- lr(1)

1. Syntactic analysis of an input sequence:
```
Input: a context-independent grammar in the file; an input sequence
Output: syntactic analysis corresponding to the input sequence or an error message, if the sequence is not accepted
```

2. Syntactic analysis of a program written in minilanguage:
```
Input: FIP and minilanguage grammar
Output: syntactic analysis corresponding to the analyzed program or an error message
```

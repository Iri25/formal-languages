### Design a program that:
1. Read the elements of a finite automaton (from the keyboard or from a file, both versions must be implemented). Describe, using BNF or EBNF, how the content of the file (input file for the program)
containing the elements of the finite automaton can look like.
2. It displays, through a menu, the following elements of the automaton: the set of states, the alphabet, the transitions, the set of final states.
3. For a deterministic finite automaton, check if a sequence is accepted by the finite automaton.
4. For a deterministic finite automaton, determine the longest prefix in a given sequence that is a sequence accepted by the automaton.

A file is created that contains the description (according to the specification) of an AFD that describes the whole constants (literals) in Java.
